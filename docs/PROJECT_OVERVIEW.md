# PE-Eval: Project Overview

## What We're Building

PE-Eval is an intelligent document analysis system for private equity firms that automatically monitors company folders in Google Drive and extracts critical financial metrics from uploaded documents. When a new financial document is added to a company's folder, the system immediately processes it, extracts key metrics like revenue and valuation, and updates a living analysis report that evolves with each new piece of information.

## The Problem We're Solving

Private equity firms spend countless hours manually reviewing financial documents, extracting metrics, and updating analysis reports. This process is:
- **Time-consuming**: Analysts spend time on manual data extraction
- **Error-prone**: Manual extraction leads to inconsistencies and missed insights
- **Reactive**: Analysis is only updated when someone remembers to check for new documents
- **Fragmented**: Information is scattered across emails, spreadsheets, and documents

## Our Solution

PE-Eval transforms this manual process into an automated, intelligent system that:

### 1. Monitors Document Uploads Automatically
- Each portfolio company has a dedicated Google Drive folder
- The system watches these folders 24/7 for new documents
- When a document is uploaded, processing begins immediately
- No manual intervention required - it just works

### 2. Extracts Financial Metrics Intelligently
- Processes any business document format (PDF, Excel, Word, PowerPoint)
- Accurately identifies and extracts key financial metric types
- For example (but not limited to):
  - **Revenue**: Annual, quarterly, monthly revenue figures
  - **Valuation**: Company valuation and funding rounds
  - **ARR**: Annual recurring revenue for SaaS companies
  - **Growth Rates**: Year-over-year, CAGR, month-over-month growth
  - **Customer Metrics**: Customer count, user base, client numbers
  - **Burn Rate**: Monthly/quarterly cash burn for startups

### 3. Maintains Living Analysis Reports
- Returns comprehensive analysis report
- Reports update automatically when new documents arrive
- Shows how metrics change over time (trend analysis)
- Highlights significant changes that require attention
- Provides complete audit trail of which document provided which insight

### 4. Delivers Instant Intelligence
- Real-time notifications when important metrics change
- Alerts for significant variations (>10% change or >$1M difference)
- Dashboard showing latest metrics for all portfolio companies
- Historical context showing 6+ months of trends

## How It Works

### The User Experience

1. **Initial Setup** (One-time, 5 minutes)
   - Create a folder in Google Drive for a portfolio company
   - Connect the folder to PE-Eval
   - System automatically creates tracking spreadsheets

2. **Document Upload** (Ongoing, automatic)
   - Drop any financial document into the company's folder
   - System detects the new document within seconds
   - Processing begins automatically

3. **Instant Results** (Real-time)
   - Metrics extracted and displayed within 2-5 minutes
   - Analysis report updates with new information
   - Alerts sent if significant changes detected
   - Dashboard reflects latest company status

4. **Progressive Intelligence** (Continuous improvement)
   - Each new document adds to the knowledge base
   - Analysis becomes more comprehensive over time
   - Trends and patterns emerge from historical data
   - Investment decisions backed by complete evidence trail

### Behind the Scenes

When a document is uploaded:
1. **Detection**: Google Drive sends a push notification to PE-Eval
2. **Extraction**: Document content is extracted (text, tables, charts)
3. **Analysis**: AI identifies and extracts financial metrics
4. **Storage**: Metrics stored in time-series database with timestamps
5. **Comparison**: System calculates changes from previous values
6. **Update**: Analysis report updates with new insights
7. **Alert**: Notifications sent for material changes

## Key Capabilities

### Document Understanding
- **Multi-format Support**: Handles any standard business document
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Understands context, not just keywords
- **Table Recognition**: Extracts data from financial tables

- **Period Detection**: Understands Q1 2024, FY2023, YTD, etc.
- **Currency Handling**: Manages USD, EUR, GBP, and other currencies
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides certainty level for each extraction

### Analysis Evolution
